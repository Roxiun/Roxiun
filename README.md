# Biography
My name is Kaniye Poot and I was was born in Sydney, Australia on the 13th of Jully 1994 to a Dutch father and an Australian mother. Since then I have migrated to the Netherlands and am currently completing a Master’s degree in History at the University of Groningen. My father's family is of Minnesotan and Dutch heritage. Their surname is pronounced “poot” and they are called “poets” in their native language, Dutch.

My family migrated from the Netherlands to Australia when I was just a child. My first memories of living in the Netherlands as being “cold and rainy”. When I was three years old, my family moved into a larger home with more space. The weather in her new hometown was cold during the winter months. However, I still enjoy spending time outdoors with my family during these months. I enjoyed playing Lacrosse with other children on local parks or going for horse riding lessons after school with my friends from different classes. I have always loved riding horses and playing Lacrosse since childhood. 

In 2022, I moved back to the Netherlands. My first impressions of the Netherlands when I moved there as being “cold, rainy and dark” but also beautiful and full of history and cultures. Staying warm indoors was difficult that winter since the climate was so cold outside. Her family found it difficult to adapt to life there that first winter as they were not used to such cold weather or darkness during November— one of the coldest months of the year in the Netherlands. They soon found an apartment they could warm up at night by turning on their heating systems or using space heaters. 

They also had trouble adjusting to eating traditional Dutch food that consisted mainly of heavy stews or meats due to their Australian background instead of fish like most Dutch people eat traditionally at home during colder months like they did back home in their native country! After moving into their new home, Kaniye recalls how excited she was when Holland hosted its annual football (soccer) World Cup tournament as this event brought joy to Australians who were passionate about soccer too! 


After moving from Australia, Kaniye found it easier than ever before now that she lives under easier circumstances in Holland compared with what she experienced growing up under stricter circumstances back home where everything moves slower under stricter conditions! Although winter can be very cold here too, most days are quite mild, compared with Australia where temperatures are much hotter than they are here at this time of year!
